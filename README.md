# Doctors Visit Analysis

## Project Overview
This project dives deep into healthcare data analysis to understand patterns and insights related to doctor visits, illness prevalence, and the socioeconomic factors affecting healthcare utilization. Using data visualization and statistical analysis, we address various problem statements that reveal how different demographic and socioeconomic variables influence healthcare access and use.

## Problem Statements Addressed
1. **Number of Days of Reduced Activity by Gender**  
   Analyzed the impact of illness on the number of days males and females experience reduced activity.
   
2. **How Income Affects the Number of Visits to the Hospital**  
   Created a scatter plot to visualize how income levels impact hospital visit frequency.
   
3. **Count of Males and Females Affected by Illness**  
   Developed a pie chart to display the proportion of males and females affected by illness.
   
4. **Percentage of People with Different Types of Health Insurance**  
   Used a pie plot to show the percentage of people with government health insurance (due to low income or age/disability/veteran status) and private health insurance.
   
5. **Box Plot for Doctor Visits Across Age Groups by Gender**  
   Visualized the variation in doctor visits among different age groups and genders.
   
6. **Comparison of Chronic Condition Statuses**  
   Analyzed and compared the impact of `nchronic` (number of chronic conditions) and `lchronic` (long-term chronic conditions) on doctor visits.
   
7. **Correlation Analysis**  
   Investigated the correlation between doctor visits and variables like age, gender, chronic conditions, income level, and insurance status to derive meaningful insights about healthcare utilization.

## Project Description
- The project aims to provide insights into healthcare behavior by analyzing patterns in illness, doctor visits, and health insurance status.
- Visualizations such as scatter plots, pie charts, box plots, and heatmaps were used to represent the data clearly and effectively.
- The analysis highlights significant correlations and differences in healthcare access based on gender, age, income, and chronic conditions.

## End Users
- **Healthcare Providers**: To understand patient behavior and optimize healthcare delivery.
- **Policy Makers**: To identify areas that need policy intervention for better healthcare access.
- **Insurance Companies**: To tailor insurance plans based on demographic data and illness patterns.
- **Researchers**: To further explore healthcare utilization and related socioeconomic factors.

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `plotly` for interactive visualizations
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- **Tools**: GitHub for version control

## Key Visualizations
1. **Bar Chart**: Reduced activity days by gender.
2. **Scatter Plot**: Hospital visits vs. income.
3. **Pie Charts**: Illness distribution by gender and health insurance types.
4. **Box Plot**: Doctor visits by age group and gender.
5. **Heatmap**: Correlation between key variables.
